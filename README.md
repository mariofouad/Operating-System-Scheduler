# Overview
This was the project of the "Operating Systems" course at Cairo University, Computer Engineering Department. It was aimed after the completion of this project that we will be able to:
* Understand unstructured, natural language problem descriptions and derive an appropriate design.
* Intuitively modularize a design into independent components and divide these components among team members.
* Build and use data structures to implement the proposed design.
* Fork and manipulate terminal processes to simulate the scheduling process.
* Allocate and deallocate memory for processes.
* Build GUI for user inputs and make images for output files.
# Introduction
Process scheduling is allocating resources to different processes so that they can be completed in an efficient and timely manner. The main objectives of scheduling are to optimize the use of resources, keep the CPU as busy as possible, have maximum utilization of the CPU, minimize response time and waiting time, and allocate and deallocate memory for processes being scheduled.
# How To Run
Using Visual Studio in a Linux environment:
1. Download all files on your local machine.
2. Open the "code" folder.
3. Run "make" in the terminal.
4. Run "make run" in the terminal.
# How To Use
1. Enter your preferred scheduling algorithms.
2. In the case of Round-Robin enter the quantum quantity.
3. Finally, enter a "test" for the test case file name.
